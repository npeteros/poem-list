            "poem": "In this world of uncertainty and doubt\nWhen there seems no safe place and I freak out\n\nYou never fail to call me out\nTo silence my fears, my anxiety, and my doubt\n\nIn this world where creeps and monsters roam about,\nIn this world of demons and devils breaking out\nIn this world where darkness rise and the light is blot out\nYou bring forth a world of peace, harmony, and safe hideout\n\nA world of serenity and tranquility\nCuring a heart filled with trauma and instability\nA heart you did not destroy\nBut a heart you cured for this young boy\n\nSuch is the reason I found love in you"

            "poem": "Perhaps home is not a place\nNeither a building nor an apartment\nBut an inviting warm embrace\nOf one who has filled my heart with glee\nOne who has dispelled my old sorrows and worry\nAnd has made tomorrow that of a worthy journey\nPerhaps home is someone who holds my present\nAt such unimaginable heights of delight and pleasure\nAs my anger, my sorrow, my fear, and my leisure\nBurn like a raging flame and a dying Ember\nMy home is the drop of my tear and the crack of my grin\nThe joy of my laugh and the paleness of my skin\nMy home excites, nurtures, and exhilirates me\nMakes me feel warm, sound, the safest I could be\nPerhaps my home is not a place I can be in\nBut someone I hold dearest in my heart\nIt is the constant feeling of love, comfort, and solace\nWhether we're near and together or miles and miles apart."
