            "poem": "In this world of uncertainty and doubt\nWhen there seems no safe place and I freak out\n\nYou never fail to call me out\nTo silence my fears, my anxiety, and my doubt\n\nIn this world where creeps and monsters roam about,\nIn this world of demons and devils breaking out\nIn this world where darkness rise and the light is blot out\nYou bring forth a world of peace, harmony, and safe hideout\n\nA world of serenity and tranquility\nCuring a heart filled with trauma and instability\nA heart you did not destroy\nBut a heart you cured for this young boy\n\nSuch is the reason I found love in you"
